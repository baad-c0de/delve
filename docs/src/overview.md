# Overview

Delve is a Minecraft clone that I've started to hone my game programming skills
in Rust.  It is a game genre where I don't care too much about graphics but
still have to solve 3D problems.

This game can cover areas of rendering, audio, physics, animation, game systems,
particle effects and many other apsects of game development.

I also intend to keep a dev-diary.  I plan to spend one hour every free lunch
time and try to get as much done within that hour, then in the evening I will
write about it.  I also plan to take screenshots to demonstrate progression.

I hope you find this document interesting.
