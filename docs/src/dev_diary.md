# Dev Diary

This section contains the pages I wrote journaling my adventure in writing a
voxel-engine-based game.

Each day represents 1-2 hours work as that is all I will devote each day to it.
The days are numbered according to work done so days I don't work are not
included in the count.  For example, if day 1 is on Monday, then I do no work on
Tuesday and more work on Wednesday, then day 2 will refer to Wednesday.

Each day I try to add some small feature to the game to further my progress.
And then I will try to add video links or screenshots to document them.

Within this text you can read about my decision making process and what decision
I do eventually make (good or bad).
